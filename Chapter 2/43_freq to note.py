"""
In the previous question you converted from a noteâ€™s name to its frequency. In this
question you will write a program that reverses that process. Begin by reading a
frequency from the user. If the frequency is within one Hertz of a value listed in
the table in the previous question then report the name of the corresponding note.
Otherwise report that the frequency does not correspond to a known note. In this
exercise you only need to consider the notes listed in the table. There is no need to
consider notes from other octaves.
