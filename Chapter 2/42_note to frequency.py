"""
The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle C, along
with their frequencies.

Note Frequency (Hz)
C4 261.63
D4 293.66
E4 329.63
F4 349.23
G4 392.00
A4 440.00
B4 493.88

Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and
displays the noteâ€™s frequency. Your program should support all of the notes listed
previously.
Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously
you should add support for all of the notes from C0 to C8. While this could be
done by adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is
cumbersome, inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise. Instead,
you should exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular,
the frequency of any note in octave n is half the frequency of the corresponding
note in octave n + 1. By using this relationship, you should be able to
add support for the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if
statement.
