Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user.Your program should
compute and display:
• The sum of a and b
• The difference when b is subtracted from a
• The product of a and b
• The quotient when a is divided by b
• The remainder when a is divided by b
• The result of log10 a
• The result of a raised to the power of b
Hint: You will probably find the log10 function in the math module helpful
for computing the second last item in the list.
